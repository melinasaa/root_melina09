                    <h3 id="right">I picked this website as one of my examples because I remember opening it for the
                        first time and
                        finding it super fun
                        and interesting. I think that the animations included on the website make it stand out compared
                        to other university
                        websites that are more basic, which is good because it makes it memorable to the people visiting
                        the page. I also really
                        like how colorful and visually interesting it is and it fits with the school since it's an art
                        and design school.

                    <h4 id="left">STAR WARS (intro)</h4>
                    <h3 id="left">When I started researching for this assignment, the Star Wars intro was one of the
                        first things I thought of. The motion
                        of the scrolling text is super iconic and immediately recognizable to anyone who sees it so I
                        felt it was important to
                        include. I think it works well at the start of the film and gives you information and context to
                        what is happening in
                        the universe before the movie starts and shows an interesting way to display text and have it go
                        away in perspective
                        instead of it just scrolling off screen.

                    <h3 id="right">These are the end credits to the recent Percy Jackson show and I wanted to include
                        them because I remember watching them
                        for the first time and really liking them. In general, people, including myself, tend to skip
                        the credits at the end of
                        movies/shows because they are often pretty boring. However, I found that these were super
                        interesting because of the
                        slight motion the graphics have that make them visually more interesting than just having a
                        static image and it worked
                        in making me watch them even though the credits are pretty long.

                    <h4>STRANGER THINGS (intro)</h4>
                    <h3 id="left">The Stranger Things intro is the other one immediately thought of when researching for
                        examples. It is a lot more simple
                        than other tv intros, but I think it is very effective and super recognizable. The red glowing
                        lines in the background
                        make the intro visually more interesting as they keep moving around the actorsâ€™ names and then
                        are revealed to spell
                        Stranger Things. I thought this was interesting to include because it shows that you don't
                        always need crazy graphics to
                        make something interesting that people will remember from just seeing it a couple of times.

                    <h3 id="right">I stumbled upon this website kind of randomly when searching the web for different
                        motion graphics examples. The white
                        opening page immediately caught my attention and I was truly surprised by what came after. I
                        found the movement of the
                        shapes moving around the spell the name of the brand really creative and I found it really fit
                        the aesthetic the website
                        was going for. All in all, I found this website to be really cool and that is why I wanted to
                        add it to this assignment.
