                    <h3 id="right">I picked this website as one of my examples because I remember opening it for the
                        first time and
                        finding it super fun
                        and interesting. I think that the animations included on the website make it stand out compared
                        to other university
                        websites that are more basic, which is good because it makes it memorable to the people visiting
                        the page. I also really
                        like how colorful and visually interesting it is and it fits with the school since it's an art
                        and design school.

                    <h4 id="left">STAR WARS (intro)</h4>
                    <h3 id="left">When I started researching for this assignment, the Star Wars intro was one of the
                        first things I thought of. The motion
                        of the scrolling text is super iconic and immediately recognizable to anyone who sees it so I
                        felt it was important to
                        include. I think it works well at the start of the film and gives you information and context to
                        what is happening in
                        the universe before the movie starts and shows an interesting way to display text and have it go
                        away in perspective
                        instead of it just scrolling off screen.

                    <h3 id="right">While walking towards the metro in Place des Arts, I saw these screens that show all
                        kinds of ads but this one was
                        probably my favourite. I liked the simplicity of it and how they used the normally static Place
                        des Arts logo and added
                        an animation to it to make it more interesting. It shows that sometimes, just a little motion is
                        what is needed and it
                        doesn't have to be overcomplicated.

                    <h3 id="left">The Stranger Things intro is the other one I immediately thought of when researching
                        for
                        examples. It is a lot more simple
                        than other tv intros, but I think it is very effective and super recognizable. The red glowing
                        lines in the background
                        make the intro visually more interesting as they keep moving around the actors' names and then
                        are revealed to spell
                        Stranger Things. I thought this was interesting to include because it shows that you don't
                        always need crazy graphics to
                        make something interesting that people will remember from just seeing it a couple of times.

                    <h3 id="right">The metro screens are full of ads but this one really caught my eye. It's a pretty
                        simple ad for the metro but I liked
                        it because it both looks good and looks like something I would be able to do. Once again, I like
                        how it shows that just
                        doing something simple like adding animation to the original logo already makes it more engaging
                        and I also like how the
                        use of color is strategic and represents the 4 lines of the Montreal metro.

                    <h3 id="left">I found this apple ad on youtube while searching for different examples for this. I
                        really liked it because I found
                        that, even though the animations in the video are quite simple, they are effective and are eye
                        catching to the audience,
                        which is important because it's an ad. I also like the color palette that was chosen for this
                        because the green
                        represents that it's related to the environment. Also the added handwritten font makes it look
                        more fun and I like it.

                        the aesthetic the website
                        was going for. All in all, I found this website to be really cool and that is why I wanted to
                        add it to this assignment.

                        not exactly an ad but more of a sports recap and I liked that the quick motions in the animation
                        kind of represent that.
                        I also find that the movement is eyecatching as it caught my attention out of everything going
                        on in the metro and I
                        think that is something to keep in mind when doing my own animations.

                        them because I remember watching them for the first time and really liking them. In general,
                        people, including myself, tend to skip the credits at the end of movies/shows because they are
                        often pretty boring. However, I found that these were super interesting because of the slight
                        motion the graphics have that make them visually more interesting than just having a static
                        image and it worked in making me watch them even though the credits are pretty long.

                        the intro credits, which to be
                        honest I sometimes skip, are an example of motion graphics. The text flying in animation is
                        simple but i think it works
                        well when paired with the freeze frame and the bright colors. It makes the intro memorable and
                        recognizable and it's
                        also eye catching which is important because people generally skip tv show intros.

                        works because it's for AI.
                        I also like that all the colors used are the google colors because it makes it recognizable to
                        anyone watching. Also, I
                        find the smooth animations to be really satisfying and I thought it was worth mentioning.
