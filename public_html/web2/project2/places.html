        <h6 id="pd-bold-italic">WHAT IS MODERN ART?</h6>
        <p id="museum">Modern Art is the art period roughly between the 1860s and the 1970s. It represented a big change
            from its traditional
            predecessors in the styles and techniques used to create art. Modern art is characterized by the rejection
            of tradition,
            new materials and techniques, the focus on individual expression and the use of abstraction and symbolism.

            <h3 id="pd-bold-italic">THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART</h3>
            <p class="right" id="os-bold">The Museum of Modern Art, commonly known as the MoMA, was founded in 1929
                and is located in New York City. Its
                collection of over 200 000 works comprises paintings, sculptures, photography, design and more, all from
                the modern and
                contemporary art periods. <br><br>
                Personally, it is my favourite art museum I have had the opportunity to visit. It took me around 2h to
                visit the whole museum and
                it was a great experience of seeing walking around the museum since it is set up as a timeline, so you
                get to experience the different periods of modern art. I would
                totally recommend visiting the MoMA to anyone who is a fan of modern art.

            <h3 id="pd-bold-italic">THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART</h3>
            <p class="left" id="os-bold">The Metropolitan Museum of Art, commonly known as the Met is one of the most
                famous art museums in the world. Also
                located in New York City, it was founded in 1870 and has a collection of over 2 millions works from all
                around the
                world, including ancient artifacts, sculptures, european paintings, modern works and so much more.
                <br><br>The Met truly is a museum I think any art lover should visit at least once in their life. It is
                a huge
                museum that has
                something for anyone to enjoy, including a whole section dedicated to modern art. Personally, I have
                been there twice
                and spent around 6h walking around and I know I could go back and see and discover new things, which is
                why I
                love
                this museum so
                much.

            <h3 id="pd-bold-italic">THE COURTAULD GALLERY</h3>
            <p class="right" id="os-bold">Located in London and part of the Somerset House, the Courtauld Gallery is an
                art museum founded in 1932, containing
                around 30 000 works known for its collection of European art, specifically Impressionist and
                Post-Impressionist works. <br><br>While in London, we randomly stumbled upon this gallery and it was a
                great find. The whole museum took around an hour
                and a half to visit and it was a great way of seeing different modern art works in a more intimate
                setting, since the
                museum is much smaller than others but I would still recommend it all the same to anyone who finds a big
                museum a bit
                overwhelming.
