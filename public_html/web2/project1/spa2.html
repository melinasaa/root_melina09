    <main id="intro">
        <p>Formed in London in 1967, Fleetwood mac, named after two of its founders, is a soft rock band that rose to
            popularity
            in the mid 70s. They started out as a British blues band lead by Peter Green but later evolved to what they
            are
            known for today. The band released over 15 albums throughout the years and had numerous lineup changes, the
            most
            famous one being the 5 who created the album Rumours. In 1998, Fleetwood Mac was inducted in the Rock and
            Roll Hall
            of Fame, marking them as one of the most iconic bands of all time.</p>

                    Rumours is Fleetwood Mac’s 11th studio album (second with this lineup), and was released on February
                    4th, 1977. Most, if
                    not all the songs are inspired by the band’s emotional turmoil since Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie
                    Nicks were going
                    through a breakup and Christine and John McVie were going through a divorce. It is known that during
                    the recording, the
                    members would get into screaming matches but it made for very raw and relatable songs with themes of
                    love, heartache and
                    betrayal. Rumours won a grammy for album of the year in 1978 and is one of the best selling albums
                    of all time (selling
                    over 40 million copies worldwide).
