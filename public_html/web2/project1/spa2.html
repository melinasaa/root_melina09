            are
            known for today.
            <br /><br />
            They released over 15 albums throughout the years and had numerous lineup changes,
            the
            most
            famous one being the five who created the album Rumours. In 1998, Fleetwood Mac was inducted into the Rock

                        Rumours is Fleetwood Mac’s 11th studio album (second with this lineup), and was released on
                        February
                        4th, 1977.
                        <br id="space" />
                        Most its songs are inspired by the band’s emotional turmoil since Lindsey Buckingham
                        and Stevie Nicks were going through a breakup and Christine and John McVie were going through a
                        divorce. During the recording process, the band members often engaged in heated screaming
                        matches, infusing thir songs with raw emotion and authenticity. This tension contributed to
                        deeply themes of love, heartache and betrayal.
                        <br id="space" />
                        Rumours won a grammy for album of the year in 1978 and is one of the best selling
                        albums of all time, selling over 40 million copies worldwide.
