        <div id="pro">
            <p>For the Capython, my team and I had Challenge as a goal for our project. With that in mind
                we
                decided to create a sort
                of game/website with physical, mental and social challenges that the user has to overcome. <br> The
                project
                has cards
                with
                the challenges that, once completed, can be turned to reveal reward posters, which we hope would
                encourage
                people to
                complete the challenges. In addition, we created a website to help people choose what challenge category
                to pick
                as well
                to help track different tasks.

    <h2 id="role">MY ROLE </h2>
    <section id="me">
        <p>For the project, my main role was to design the mascot for our cards. We decided the mascot should
            be a dog because it would be like a therapy dog which fits the self help aspect of our project. </p>
        <div id="roles">
            <section>
                <p>I sketched out two options and then vectorized the chosen one on illustrator with 4 different colors
                    so
                    that the colors would
                    match with the cards, and a neutral one for the box.</p>

            <section>
                <p>I then also sketched out another version of the dog that
                    was then vectorized and used for one of the reward posters.</p>

                <p id="bold">LEVEL 6</p>
                <p>With support from my teacher, I can keep track of my tasks and my due dates.
                    Less than 10% of my tasks that are overdue or incomplete.
                    I let my teacher know when I need help or when I need more time to turn in work before the deadline.

            <section>
                <p id="bold">LEVEL 8</p>
                <p>I can keep track of my tasks and due dates on my own.
                    Almost none of my tasks are overdue or incomplete.
                    I can finish an important task 24 hours before it is due.
                    I integrate constructive feedback from my peers or teachers into some of my most important work
                    before I turn it in.</p>

                <p id="bold">SELF ASSESSMENT: Level 6-8</p>
                <p>I like to think I’m pretty organized when it comes to the things I have to do. I keep track of pretty
                    much everything on
                    google calendar so my tasks are very rarely late. However I do struggle a lot with procrastination
                    and normally do my
                    tasks last minute so it’s what I want to work on the most.</p>
